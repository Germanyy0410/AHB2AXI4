# AHB to AXI4 Bridge

This project provides an implementation of a bridge from AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) to AXI4 (Advanced eXtensible Interface 4).

## Description

This bridge is designed to facilitate communication between components that use the AHB interface and those that use the AXI4 interface. It translates AHB transactions into AXI4 transactions and vice versa.

## Features

- Support all AHB and AXI4 transaction types.
- Support multiple burst transfers.
- Handle AHB to AXI4 and AXI4 to AHB conversions.
